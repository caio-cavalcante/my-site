# Caio's Personal Portifolio

## Description

This project started as a simple assessment in a Web Develompent class, and became my way to present myself and my journey as a programer.

In order to put my knowledge into practice, I decided to code a website as a personal portfolio and showcase some others works I've done so far.

## How to use

Soon I'll host this website online, but for the time being, it is possible to run it locally. After downloading the repo, open a terminal on it and use ```npm run dev``` to open a localhost.
